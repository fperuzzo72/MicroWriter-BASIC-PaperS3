// Dual-boot sibling apps -- the return trip to the CrossPoint reader.
//
// This unit carries two unrelated firmwares at once, CrossPoint in app0 and
// MicroBASIC in app1, and the bootloader picks between them from otadata (see
// docs/DUAL_BOOT.md). CrossPoint's Home menu can already switch *here*; this
// is the other direction, behind the status bar's READER button.
//
// The register/detect/switch scheme is ported from CrossPoint's own
// src/util/OtaApps.h, which this repo also generates into it via
// patches/cpr-vcodex/01_create_otaapps_h.py. Identifier names are kept
// deliberately identical across all of those so the copies stay diffable --
// so `registerOtaAppName`, not this project's usual camelCase-with-a-verb
// house style.
//
// Two things CrossPoint gets from elsewhere are inlined here instead, because
// this firmware has neither:
//
//   * ota_boot::switchTo(), the raw otadata write. CrossPoint has it as
//     src/network/OtaBootSwitch.cpp for its own SD/OTA self-update. It exists
//     at all because esp_ota_set_boot_partition() fails on this silicon with a
//     bogus efuse-blk-rev verification error, so the otadata entry is written
//     by hand -- the same scheme the project's web flasher uses.
//   * which slots to offer. CrossPoint lists every other slot with a valid
//     image; this lists only the reader's, ota_0, by the owner's wish (the
//     RetroComputer in app2 is reached through the reader). It used to tell
//     the reader apart by project_name, until every app on the unit built as
//     "arduino-lib-builder" and the test hid the reader too.
